**Predicting Bond Class Using Machine Learning: A pedagogical exercise to introduce ML in a chemistry context**

The goal of this exercise is for you to go through the normal workflow of a data scientist working with machine learning to predict bond classification of diatomic molecules (ionic, covalent, metallic, or metalloid) and predict the percent ionic character of the bond. You will need to import and process data. After which, you will evaluate several different classification (bond type) and regression models (% ionic character). Once the best performing models are chosen, you will implement the algorithm for these models. Then, you will evaluate performance and tune hyperparameters of the models you implement.

This project was built and taught using Google Colab to reduce the amount of installation and setup.

This exercise was developed by Peter McPike with the help of Hakem Altawil at the Boika Research Group at the University of Akron Department of Chemistry.
